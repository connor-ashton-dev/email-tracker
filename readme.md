### How it works

Using the gmail api, we can monitor emails coming into the inbox. Using a text file with company names, we can filter out
emails we aren't looking for, and notify ourselves of the emails we are.

### To-Do

- Use Twilio to send texts
- Cache emails we have already read so we don't get repeat alerts
